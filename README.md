# master-thesis

The main functions used to run simulations and experiments are contained in `functions.R` and `functions_parallelized.R`. All other scripts source these two scripts. Scripts starting with `sim` have been used to run simulations, while scripts starting with `exp` have been used to run experiments on website analytics data. The latter data set has been handed in with the thesis. The data sets for the simulations are created within the scripts and can be reproduced using the seed.
